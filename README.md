[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FTSRG/ingraph.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FTSRG/ingraph)

[[report on openCypher TCK results]](http://docs.inf.mit.bme.hu/ingraph/pub/opencypher-report.pdf) | [[regression tests]](http://docs.inf.mit.bme.hu/ingraph/tests/regressionTests/)

For a summary on the project, visit the [ingraph web page](http://docs.inf.mit.bme.hu/ingraph/).

## User's guide

To run the tests, issue the following command:

```
./gradlew test
```

## Contributor's guide

ingraph is defined as a Gradle project.

### Prerequisites
* We recommend using IntelliJ for developing the engine, as most of it is in Scala. Install the [Scala plug-in](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/idea/plugin/1347-scala) for IntelliJ.
* For SRE and other Clojure projects we recommend Emacs with [CIDER](https://cider.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). If you want to develop Clojure in IntelliJ, check out [Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/) 

*Note.* Currently, there is no VIATRA plug-in for IntelliJ or Emacs. You are able to use the previously defined patterns, but cannot define new patterns or edit existing ones.

### Importing the projects

* Import the projects using **New** | **Project from Existing Sources...** (or simply click **Import Project** on the welcome screen).
  * Select the `ingraph` directory.
  * Tick **Auto import**.
  * Untick **Create separate module per source set**.
  * Use default Gradle wrapper as your Gradle installation.
* After importing, add the Scala SDK (version 2.11) to the module. (If you did not use Scala before, download it from the dialog box provided by IntelliJ).
